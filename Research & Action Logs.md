#### Friday, December 9
* 10:45 AM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Working on endpoint to allow the client side to READ the data for a given article through Express.
* 12:05 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> Successfully created api endpoint to search articles by name using Express app. I was able to access the articles' data through Postman (as I haven't worked on the front-end yet). 
In the process, I learned that every time I change my location (e.g. working from a caf√© or so) I need to add the IP address of the place where I am connecting to the internet to my MongoDB cluster network settings. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to access the data from my databases there.
