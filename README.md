* 17:30 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> Successfully added .env file to store without exposure password and user name for MongoDB connection.
#### Friday, December 9
* 10:45 AM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Working on endpoint to allow the client side to READ the data for a given article through Express.
* 12:05 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> Successfully created api endpoint to search article by name using an Express app. I was able to access the articles' data through Postman (as I haven't worked on the front-end yet). 
In the process, I learned that every time I change my location (e.g. working from a caf√© or so) I need to add the IP address of the place where I am connecting to the internet to my MongoDB cluster network settings. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to access the data from my databases there.
* 12:35 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Working on endpoint to allow the client side to UPDATE the data for a given article property (upVotes) using Express. This is going to allow users to up-vote an article they liked.
* 14:15 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> Successfully added api endpoint to UPDATE upVotes prop for articles on cloud database. Users are able to up-vote their favorite articles. Refactor server.js to import db connection from db.js to have dryer code.
* 14:30 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Working on endpoint to allow the client side to CREATE(add) data for a given article property (comments). This is going to allow users to add comments to an article.
* 14:50 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> Successfully added api endpoint to CREATE(add) comments for articles. Users are able to leave comments for articles.
* 14:55 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Enable the front-end to make the api requests defined above (up-voting and leaving comments). We are going to use Axios library to handle network requests.
* 15:15 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Installed Axios library into front-end directory.
* 15:53 PM <span style="color:red">Action:</span> WIP: Adding initial components for the front-end. Installed react-router-dom into front-end directory."
